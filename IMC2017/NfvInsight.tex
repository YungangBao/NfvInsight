% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\section{Introduction}

Network function virtualization (NFV) has become a hot topic, both in industry and academia. Since the publication of NFV Introductory White Paper [] of ETSI in 2012, a lot of works have been emerged in this field. Modification works of NFV were done on the whole software stack (or maybe both SW and HW stack?). There are de facto industrial NFV platform OPNFV [] as well as advanced NF allocation frameworks like OpenNF [], CoMb [] and E2 []. Also, there are works like OpenBox [] and Netbricks [] to rewrite or modify the NFs.

However, a suite of easy-to-use NFV benchmark is not yet existed. It is unavoidable to experience a time consuming process finding both open source software and proper chaining policies. According to our observation, most NFs used in papers are different open source implementations linked in different kinds of NF chain policies. So that, there is not yet a general baseline for measurement and comparison. Furthermore, the workload generator and network traffic trace used are also different, and real-world traces need to be provided to test different NF chains.

We also did a survey among top conference researchers who have experiences setting up NFV environment. In our survey, we found that the deploying time varies much due to the scale. In average, it takes around 1 month to build up a NF cluster having less than 10 VM instances. But when the scale of instances increase to over 50, the build up process can take 3-4 months or more. One of our respondent said that they were still keeping on iterating and improving their testbed constantly.

There are more complains pointing out their pain points: 1) Automate the setting up and testing process. 2) Configure and stabilize NFs (?). 3) Write rules to set up topology and enforce flow control.

In this paper, we develop a suite of NF benchmarks, which is supposed to have the following characteristics: 1) Representing typical NFs 2) Easy to deploy 3) Plenty metrics for measurement (please specify)

For the demand of representative NFs, we referred to the NFV Introductory White Paper [], which defined eight scenario of NFV use cases. Then we collected open source implementations accordingly. Table ? lists the scenarios and the information of NFs used in our benchmark. However, not only single NFs should be typical, but also the NF chains. We consulted industrial partners for the real world scenarios including (..) traditional middle boxes (and VoIP services). The typical NF chains are listed in Table ?.

For the demand of easy to deploy, we hope to achieve the goal of one-click installation, and reduce the setting up time to less than 1 week no matter the scale of the testing environment. (what’s the user interface like?) We leverage Docker and Kubernets to pack NFs in containers, manage the images, and do allocation automatically. We use OVS to do switching, and leverage pre-written scripts and Openflow rules to implement chaining and flow control. 

We leverage the monitoring function of Kubernets and provide metrics for measurement.

%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
